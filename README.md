## component

| file / directory | description |
|:-|:-|
| `images/` | images used in prt.md |
| `prt/` | sample project to be distributed |
| `prtex/prtex_a.pde` | Answer for practice Ex.A |
| `prtex/prtex_b_l.pde` | Answer for practice Ex.B. left, `hit.material.Color()` |
| `prtex/prtex_b_r.pde` | Answer for practice Ex.B. right, `hit.normal` |
| `prtex/prtex_cd.pde` | Answer for practice Ex.C and Ex.D |

Each answer under `prtex/` is only the substitution for prt/prt.pde
